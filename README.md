Proxima B is a possibly earth like planet that orbits Proxima Centauri,
closest star to our sun. If humans had a colony in Proxima B today, they
would receive news from Earth 4.2 years late due to its distance.

Since Proxima B is 4.2 light years away, it takes light 4.2 years to
make this journey, as light is the fastest thing in our universe,
our communication speed is also limited by 4.2 years.

[Proxima B News Bot](https://twitter.com/ProximaBNewsBot) is a small
Twitter bot that shares news[^1] with this time delay.

    For full disclosure, since certain news categories are targets of
    targeted disinformation, certain topics such as armed conflict and
    international politics is automatically filtered out, I am not happy
    with this either, but I don't want to inadvertantly spead targeted
    disinformation.
